# DCE Capstone Project #1: Document Remediation 
DCE Capstone project for NA PSS team members: Talia Hoffman, Meena Ramamoorthy, Jacob Yun, Jessica Zajac

## Customer problem to be solved 
<p>Pebble Pharma is a pharmaceuticals company that has struggled to modernize their onboarding process for their new hires. Historically they send multiple onboarding agreements through email and their homegrown HR system. They want to modernize this process through a front end system that tracks their entire employee journey. In addition to Adobe Acrobat Sign, they have also purchased AEM Assets, Sites and Forms. </p>
<p> Additionally, they are prioritizing accessibility of their documents. This is a companywide initiative at Pebble, particularly after an external audit revealed that they do not meet accessibility standards in multiple areas of their processes. </p>
<p> Remediation team is tasked with mass remediation effort for key HR and legal documents to bring their various documents up to date in terms of WCAG AA standards. This primary use case will focus on the 201X Benefits Packet. </p>

## Remediation plan 
  1. Analyzed the document elements.

  3. Verified tags and set the reading order utilizing the reading order tool within Acrobat.
  4. Ran multiple iterations of the accessibility checker within Acrobat and revise as needed.

### Document Issues
#### Logical Reading Order
<p> Manual check was done for the reading order of this document. </p>
#### Color Contrast
<p> Replaced document colors and used high-contrast colors on document wherever possible (without altering  customerâ€™s color palette). </p>
### Page Content Issues
#### Tagged annotations
<p> Element 1 (link) not tagged. (page 2) </p>
<p> Element 2 - 13 (table cells) marked as annotation and not tagged. (page 4)</p>
<p> These issues were caused by the consolidation of the separate PDF files into the original booklet size. </p>
### Tables
#### Headers
<p> Element 1 is missing headers. (page 4) </p>
#### Regularity
<p> Table has 2 rows with 3 columns, and 2 rows with 2 columns. Typically tables are evenly distributed throughout. (page 8) </p>
<p> This was skipped as part of the accessibility check since the original document did not contain the evenly distributed rows and columns. We left it as is to not tamper with the customer's document. </p>

## Delivery workflow

## Customer outcome and value realized 
<p> Utilizing a front end system and having it seamlessly integrated with Adobe Acrobat Sign and AEM created a consolidated system for Pebble Pharm. This new system resulted in a 1-hour time savings for each benefit packet that's being sent out to new employees. </p>
<p> The HR team also reported a spike in positive user experience feedback from those using assistive tools. There was a decreased number of calls to help desk regarding accessibility issues for visually impaired users by 70%. This ultimately led to a 40% increase in help desk tickets closed for other matters. </p>
<p> We made many improvements on meeting the accessibility standards for this 201X benefit packet. Unfortunately, the accessibility report does show some issues that were unresolved. Without the source document, full remediation was not possible. With that being said, customer is satisfied with the results with the improvement of user experience for those using assistive tools. The HR team is setting the precedent for other teams to prioritize PDF accessibility within the company, since this engagement ultimately elevated their candidates' user experience. </p>
