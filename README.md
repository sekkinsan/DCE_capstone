## Capstone Project #1: Document Remediation 

### Customer problem to be solved 
<p>Pebble Pharma is a pharmaceuticals company that has struggled to modernize their onboarding process for their new hires. Historically they send multiple onboarding agreements through email and their homegrown HR system. They want to modernize this process through a front end system that tracks their entire employee journey. In addition to Adobe Acrobat Sign, they have also purchased AEM Assets, Sites and Forms. </p>
<br>
<p> Finally, they are prioritizing accessibility of their documents. This is a companywide initiative at Pebble, particularly after an external audit revealed that they do not meet accessibility standards in multiple areas of their processes. </p>
<br>

### Methodology 

<br>

### [PDF accessibility report of poorly tagged file](https://github.com/sekkinsan/DCE_capstone/blob/main/Pebble_Pharm_201X_Benefits.pdf.accreport.html) 

<br>

### Remediation plan 
  1. Verified that the PDF was not created from a scanned image 
  2. Verified that the PDF contained fillable form fields and added those form fields within Acrobat 
  3. Verified that the PDF contained links and added those links to direct recipients correctly 
  4. Verified that the PDF did not contain multimedia 
  5. Analyzed the document elements 
  6. Tagged the document and set the reading order 
  7. Ran multiple iterations of the accessibility checker within Acrobat and revise as needed

### Customer outcome and value realized 
<p> Utilizing a front end system and having it seamlessly integrated with Adobe Acrobat Sign and AEM created a consolidated system for Pebble Pharm. This new system resulted in a 1-hour time savings for each benefit packet that's being sent out to new employees. </p>
<br>
<p> Accessibility standards were also met for this 201X benefit packet, and the HR team is setting the precedent for other teams to prioritize PDF accessibility within the company </p>
